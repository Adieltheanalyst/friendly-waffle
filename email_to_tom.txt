Subject: Unable to Attend 10am Nairobi Java Meeting

Hi Tom,

I'm writing to let you know that I won't be able to make it to our scheduled 10am meeting at Nairobi Java. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Let me know if there's a chance to reschedule or discuss this at another time.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Adiel
